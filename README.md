## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using the command git clone https://github.com/Sewder/MyPongGame.git
Make sure you have Python 3.x and Pygame installed on your machine. If you don't have Pygame installed, you can install it using pip install pygame.
Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal/command prompt.
Run the command python pong.py to start the game.
## Usage
The game is a two-player game, where each player controls a paddle to hit the ball and prevent it from going past their side of the screen. The left paddle is controlled using the W and S keys, and the right paddle is controlled using the up and down arrow keys. The game ends when one player scores 10 points.

## Gameplay
The game is a recreation of the classic Pong game, where each player controls a paddle to hit the ball back and forth across the screen. The ball bounces off the top and bottom walls of the screen, as well as the paddles. If the ball goes past one player's paddle and hits the wall behind it, the other player scores a point.
